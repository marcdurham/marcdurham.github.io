# Marc Durham's Resume
## Qualifications
I am a full stack web & desktop software developer, I code, test, architect, and design software.

I’ve coded and maintained, architected from top to bottom, and built automated tests for web sites, web store fronts, internal dashboards with data crawlers, mobile language translation (app) tools, hydraulic flow calculation & design software, graphical mapping tools, AutoCAD drawing modules, package & deployment scripts, phone system scripts, customer service tracking & estimation systems, job costing & payroll software, and various tools to integrate, or sync data, between different systems and databases.

Over the years, working on complex projects, I’ve learned that programming isn’t just code and algorithms, so I’ve learned, and I continue to learn, various disciplines used in ensuring codebases are clean, tested, and maintainable.

I’ve built these things with teams and independently in both corporate environments and in small businesses.  In both environments I’ve learned to appreciate and understand the needs of the business and the relationships with the people I work with.

## Personal Projects
### Pinyiner (Kotlin, Android)
An Android app, not on the market currently but for my own use and a few friends, that translates simplified Chinese text into a three-line English + pronunciation (Pinyin) + Chinese word groups, different than a full translation app in that it maintains Chinese word ordering and sentence structure.  The app allows the user to tap any word in a sentence and change or shorten pronunciation and definition.  I used the app myself in China to help me translate text messages to and from Chinese web sites and from the WeChat app, which is popular in China.

### SplitReader (Java, Android, EPUB)
If an epub was translated into English and Chinese this Android app, written in Java, would display, side-by-side, two epub files at once, one in Chinese and one in English.  It synchronized chapter and paragraph navigation so that the same thing is shown in both languages side by side.

### TerritoryMapper (C#, .NET, WinForms)
This was a tool used to draw borders around groups of geocoded addresses on a map to be printed or electronically distributed as PDFs or spreadsheets for visit routes, essentially dividing maps into territories.  It had an XML file format that it could synchronize with a MS-SQL database, or export into csv, or synchronize with Google spread sheets.  It also was able to import and export Google’s KML files to be used in Google’s map apps.
