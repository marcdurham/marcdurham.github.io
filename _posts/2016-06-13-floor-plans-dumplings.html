<div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I few minutes ago I was procrastinating and wandering from the living area into the kitchen searching for food, living up to my reputation as a "snacker."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was dark, only the kitchen lights were lit, lighting up the living area from far away, and I couldn't help but notice that my wife was re-watching some old TV show that had been saved on her laptop way back when we lived in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Due to being daily immersed in a foreign language and culture and due to slow and restricted Trans-Pacific Internet connections: recorded American TV shows are extra valuable to us "Expats" here in China.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Like cigarettes in prison.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But what struck me about this TV show, at that moment standing in a dimly lit room eating my second tiny bag of some sort of vanilla cookies that had a suspicious faint moldy taste when I got to the bottom of the bag: was the floor plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The floor plan of the set of the TV show.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">If I'm honest I'd have to say that what "struck me" was something self-absorbed, just about myself, I realized that I had a subconscious obsession with floor plans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Becky had her earphones plugged in so all I could see was actors silently moving their lips as they walked through a spacious apartment from room to hallway to room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was feeling a little sense of frustration at the size and layout of the apartment, how many rooms did it have?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Was there a hallway running along the side of the apartment or down the center with rooms on either side? I had seen this show many times and many scenes had taken place it that same apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I just couldn't picture the layout properly in my head.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I also realized that I had the blueprints for the Starship Enterprise NCC-1701-D, all 42 decks, in a box somewhere in my parents garage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't bear to throw the away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I might have them send it to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There's a pattern here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At one point, when I was probably about 20, I pulled out all of the (D-Sized) blue prints and taped them to the walls of my bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It took up more than one wall, kind of like a crazy person's padded cell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Only I didn't have them up for very long, eventually I got bored with them and took them down, that's why I call it a "subsconcious obsession" instead of just a plain old "obsession."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think I worried about them getting damaged, walls are dangerous places.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Also I usually I don't remember my dreams, but occasionally I'll remember them, and most of time all I remember are buildings and rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In other words, layouts and floor plans.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">But before you go thinking that I should have been an architect, I must tell you that I don't think I'm any good at it, at understanding and visualizing floor spaces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Like for example, here in China we live on the fourth floor of a fifteen story building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The bottom two floors are retail space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>There is a dumpling restaurant basically right underneath us, on the first floor, or partly underneath us, it's complicated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can't go into that restaurant without thinking about it, wondering if I'm standing three stories under my bed or under the living room, and I'm pretty sure part of the restaurant extends under our neighbors apartment.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I know what you're thinking: He lives over a dumpling restaurant?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>How convenient!</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yes, don't be jealous, the dumpling restaurant is about 15 feet from the "lobby" door on our first floor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We go down the elevator, out the door, turn right, walk 15 feet on the sidewalk, and into XiJiaDe (</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Microsoft YaHei&quot;;">喜家德</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>XiJiaDe is a chain with hundreds of dumpling restaurants, it takes great pride in it's dumpling quality and the cleanliness of it's restaurants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And I can tell you that I can't think of any restaurants in the States, especially chains, that are cleaner than XiJiaDe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have seen them more than once tip their dining tables onto their sides so that they can mop the bottoms of the steel pedestals of their tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Their dumpling assemblers stand in a glass windowed assembly area and wear plastic face masks for cleanliness.</span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Why don't I just give you a link to their website: <a href="http://xijiade.com.cn/">http://xijiade.com.cn</a><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>(I should sell ad space eh?)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can even watch one of the videos that I've seen a hundred times playing on their dining room TVs on an endless loop.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I can also tell you that Becky and I have dined there scores of times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It's fairly cheap, the food is pretty good, it's open past nine, the wait staff is very friendly, and, one of my favorite features in restaurants here, is that they have pictures on the menu so I know exactly what I'm ordering without a dictionary!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's our comfort place.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><!--StartFragment-->                                       <!--EndFragment--><br /><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">If you come and visit us here in China we will take you there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So far I think everyone who has visited us has gone there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Whether they liked it or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>And if you follow my infrequent blog entries and you know about my subconscious obsession you can help me figure out what part of our apartment the table we sit at is directly underneath.</div>
