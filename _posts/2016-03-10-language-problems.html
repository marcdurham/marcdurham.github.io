No, not that kind of language problem. &nbsp;You're probably thinking this blog entry title is about learning a foreign language or about being confused by telemarketers, and them being more confused than you are. <br /><br />Telemarketer: "Are you Chinese?" <br />Me: "No I'm American"<br />Telemarketer: "But aren't you in China?"<br />I could hear his brain working: "But I called a Chinese phone number... how did I get the wrong country? &nbsp;What am I supposed to do now?"<br /><br />OK, I can't really read minds, and that's probably not was he was thinking. &nbsp;I was mostly worried that he was calling about a recent order I had made on taobao.com, China's Ebay. &nbsp;If there were any problems with the order, or if he needed more details, he didn't get them from me. &nbsp;I didn't understand a word he said. &nbsp;He's one of those people who doesn't know how to slow down and dumb down his speech for foreigners. &nbsp;...and I'm one of those foreigners who gets confused easily and needs to learn the local language better.<br /><br />But, like I said, that's not the "Language Problem" I'm talking about in the title of this blog entry. &nbsp;I'm talking about the language problem I developed when I was five years old. &nbsp;I still remember my dad making me put soap in my mouth. &nbsp;I think I had said something to my mother that he didn't like. &nbsp;Sorry mom.<br /><br />I can honestly say that even though I developed, or discovered, the ability to swear at the age of five, that I've never had a problem controlling it. &nbsp; I have never spent much time around people who use "bad language," and I usually want people around me to feel respected.<br /><br />But things are a little different here. &nbsp;No, I haven't developed a potty mouth, but there's a new temptation here that I never thought about before. &nbsp;If I'm on the bus, full of people, I can say whatever I want, no one will really understand me. &nbsp;And, importantly, no one will feel disrespected. &nbsp;This is not a temptation I expected before I came here. &nbsp;I've thought about this too many times while riding the bus or walking down the street. &nbsp;So pray for me.<br /><br />Also take this as a cautionary tale if you decide to live somewhere no one speaks your favorite language. &nbsp;You can hear you. &nbsp;So keep it clean.<br /><br />Also: Yes, some parts of big cities like this smell really bad, but there's no reason to yell what you think you smell.
