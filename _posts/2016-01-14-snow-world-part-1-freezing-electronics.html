I always thought that electronics, computers and phones, liked to be cold. &nbsp;Probably because some super computers have super cooled chips. &nbsp;But that's only partially true with smart phones, some parts really don't like the cold, like the battery. <br /><br />A Few days ago Becky, Jessica, and I, put on our warmest long-underwear, our woolen long-sleeved moisture-wicking undershirts, our down-stuffed jackets, you get the idea. Then, after getting a little lost, we met three of our friends, got on a bus for about 45 minutes, then we got off a little sweaty from all the clothes we were wearing. &nbsp;After getting off the bus we walked for several blocks through the city to the riverside. &nbsp;It started to get exciting when we saw pillars lining the sidewalk that were made from ice blocks. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><br /></div>On the ice there were dogs tied to sleds, horses, snowmobiles, six wheelers and four wheelers with sleds tied to the back of them. &nbsp;There were people ice skating, playing games, people selling ice cleats, food, scarfs, hats, and everything else. &nbsp;Then there were six of us walking slowly and carefully across the ice.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both;

text-align: center;"><br /></div>I was in the back of the pack walking the slowest. &nbsp;The ice was smooth and slippery. &nbsp;I felt like every step I took slipped a little. &nbsp;After walking about a hundred feet my thighs and legs were already starting to feel fatigued from using my seldom used anti-slipping muscles. <br /><br />I was starting to worry. &nbsp;We had to walk exactly 1.0 km on the ice and I was already starting to feel it at 0.2% of the distance that I was planning to walk. &nbsp;But thank goodness, after another hundred feet the smooth ice disappeared and was replaced with packed snow, a hundred times easier to walk on. &nbsp;The smooth ice, behind us, had been cleared off for ice skating and stuff. &nbsp;But I didn't know this when I started walking. &nbsp;Thank goodness! &nbsp;I almost back ashore and watch Star Wars in the IMAX.<br /><br />&nbsp;About halfway across the river the cold started to get to us. &nbsp;I kept trying to take pictures but my hands would go numb so quickly, in seconds instead of minutes. &nbsp;Thank goodness I had mittens so I could make fists inside of them to warm my fingers. We also started to realize that our phones weren't working. &nbsp;It was too cold, the batteries were dying! &nbsp;I guess the chemicals inside the batteries were not able to produce enough electricity because they were freezing. &nbsp;One of our friends who had been around for a few years said we couldn't keep our phones in our outside pockets or they would freeze like that. &nbsp;So I kept my phone in my pants pocket, which was covered by my big down jacket.<br /><br />Keeping it there, in my pants pocket, kept my phone working. &nbsp;But to actually use it I had to take it out, and I had to use my bare hands to operate the touch screen. &nbsp;At one point during the day I tried taking a sphere photo. &nbsp;A sphere photo is a camera feature of many phones that allows you to take pictures in every direction then, when you're done, it stitches them back together into a rotating sphere. &nbsp;It's like being there almost. &nbsp;It usually takes a few minutes to take all of the pictures to do this, maybe fifty pictures in three minutes, but my phone died completely right after the last picture and I lost all of the fifty sphere shots. &nbsp;Which is too bad, I liked that one.<br /><br />And with that sad note I'm ending this blog entry, I'm tired. &nbsp;I'll add another one about Snow World later.<br /><br /><br /><br />
