      <!--StartFragment-->   <!--EndFragment--><br /><div style="border-width: 100%; direction: ltr;"> <div style="direction: ltr; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in; width: 6.109in;"> <div style="direction: ltr; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in; width: 6.109in;"> <div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">(By the way, I have recently enabled comments on these blog entries if you want to comment the comments are emailed to me then they show up at the end of the blog entry)</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Last night I got up to go to the bathroom, something I started doing at age 30 when I lived in Taiwan (I even blogged about), when I came back from the bathroom I quietly lowered myself back into the body indentation where I had been trying to sleep before I went to the bathroom, I didn't want to wake my wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>About a week or two ago we bought a memory foam mattress topper for our bed, so now I can lay on my side without my arm and shoulder going numb, my body leaves and indentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This "lowering myself" down was a very unpleasant, the indentation from where I had been trying to sleep before was soaked with my own sweat, which was now cooled down from the fan that was blowing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Are you sure you want to keep reading?</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I'm not grossed out by sweat normally, actually I'd say that I almost like sweating sometimes, it feels purifying to me when sweat drips off my chin, as long as I'm wearing the right clothes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Not only that but I sweat to some degree year round, I hear myself often brag "I start to sweat when it's 50 degrees outside," so I'd be very unhappy all the time if sweat grossed me out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But a bed soaked in cold sweat goes over the line with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Needless to say, it's been swelteringly hot here in northern China lately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Just a few days ago we had three new fans delivered, the one fan just wasn't enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A friend of ours told us yesterday that it was 34 degrees! That’s 93.2 degrees Fahrenheit, even temperatures have to be translated here, I think in metric now.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Do you think I'm cool now because I think in metric?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I do.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">So anyway, I'm laying in bed restlessly listening to the street noises, and then one of the noises compels me to get out of my now warmed up sweaty bed indentation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sweat doesn't feel as gross when it's warmed up by your body, or in this case: re-warmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Now, I wouldn't get out<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>bed for just any sound, at a subconscious level I knew that my sweat would start to cool down, getting grosser and grosser every minute I was away from my sleeping indentation, so I was reluctant to leave it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But I heard someone yelling.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Yelling is very common here, people yell for many more reasons than they do in the Western world I grew up in, not just when they're at a sports event or when they're angry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But this voice seemed angry, and it kept going on and on, so I got up to go the our fourth floor window and check it out.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I wish I could describe the scene below me better, but across the street, maybe 150 feet to give you an idea of distance, there was a restaurant, the one that specializes in donkey meat, that had it's lights on still and I could see the outlines of people standing in the door way and I could hear a scraping sound that sounded like someone dragging a garbage can on the sidewalk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If memory serves, I could also hear a thumping sound, like someone was kicking a garbage can too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I could also see a man standing on the sidewalk, it looked like he was yelling at the people standing in the restaurant doorway.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I never did figure out what he was yelling about, for anger or for some other reason, but I later figured out that the thumping sound was the sound of workers tossing bricks from the brick sidewalk into the back of a big blue truck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I'm sorry that the mystery of the angry sounding yelling man will not be solved in this blog entry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But, even though it's fairly common to hear yelling, it does motivate one to check it out and see what's going on, maybe it's human nature, or just me, I don't know.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">There is still another mystery:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As I stood there watching the man yelling across the street some movement closer to me caught my eye: two middle-aged guys on the street in nothing but their boxers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They seemed to think nothing of wearing just boxers on the street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At that time of the night there were only a few cars here and there, so of course, it was logical to wear boxers since it was also very hot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I guess I was wearing the same thing, just not on the street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A minor detail.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Below our apartment there is one of several construction zones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The construction zones are fenced in by seven feet tall plastic yellow barriers, you can't really see inside the construction zones unless you peak through the cracks between the panels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Next to the largish construction zone below our window is what I'd call a blue job shack, where the two guys in their boxers apparently came from.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It looked like they were security guards making their rounds, checking on the construction equipment to make sure no one was stealing it or messing around with it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One of them even stopped to re-secure one of the yellow plastic barrier panels after passing through it.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">After my surprise subsided from seeing two security guards walking around in their boxers on the street, I felt myself smiling, "that's pretty cool," I thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When it's hot in China, just wear your boxers, no problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I was in school I was taught that America is a land of freedom, I think those guys felt a large degree of freedom here in China, even if was surprising to see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One of the guys even stopped for few minutes to gaze at the scenery and the night traffic in the distance, wearing just his boxers and flip flops.</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">After the two guys retreated back into the blue job shack I gazed at the traffic in the distance myself …also wearing boxers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>(But inside).</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div></div></div></div>
