So everyone here becomes experts at walking on ice.&nbsp; Maybe that's normal, but it's kinda new for me, you use extra muscles when you walk like that, I'm still breaking mine in.&nbsp; I didn't slip and fall all day, that was my accomplishment.<br /><br />I've been thinking about this ice.&nbsp; Some parts of it aren't scraped and swept, like less traveled roads, they have at least six inches of that black compacted ice on them.&nbsp; It's black for many reasons, there's probably a little garbage in there, and a lot of sludge and dirt.&nbsp; The sludge here is mixed with many things, stuff you'd normally find a storm drain, and then lot's of stuff you'd find in a sewer, and then that stuff they scrape out of restaurant kitchen stoves.&nbsp; We take off our shoes here when we come inside.&nbsp; There is no running back inside to grab your keys or your wallet with your shoes on because you don't feel like putting them back on.&nbsp; Nobody in their right mind would do that here.<br /><br />But rest assured, you don't have to take off your shoes at McDonalds!&nbsp; Actually McDonalds is a nice comfortable respite here.&nbsp; Come to McDonalds, order some fries, go upstairs with your buddy, do some homework, and then take in a nap.&nbsp; I haven't done it yet, but I might.&nbsp; And I might actually buy something there too, instead of just going in with soy milk and a Chinese chicken pie.<br /><br />
