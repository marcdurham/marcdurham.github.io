The joke that's already gotten old around here is: "It's balmy outside!" &nbsp;This morning it was 25 degrees Fahrenheit. &nbsp;The ice is melting, it's been snowing and then melting. &nbsp;It's kind of weird for a Northwesterner like myself to think "Oh it's snowing, it must be getting warmer!" &nbsp;But it's true, this city has been literally and figuratively "thawing out" for the last few weeks.<br /><br />Of course we all have mixed feelings about this. &nbsp;There are ten million people in this city, we're stacked in here pretty high. &nbsp;Ten million people means a lot of traffic, garbage, and sewer. &nbsp;And it's all thawing out. &nbsp;The melting snow is black, wet, stinky, and ankle deep in some places.<br /><br />But I've learned to appreciate how such things are dealt with here. &nbsp;I've come to respect the thousands of people with shovels, brooms, ice chippers, and giant tractors. &nbsp;Just the other night a tractor, the size of a house, pushed some of that black slushy-like sludge into the path of twenty of us pedestrians who were frantically trying to cross the street. &nbsp;It was like a trail was being washed out by a black flash flood right in front of us. &nbsp;But I'm being dramatic: we just walked to the right and avoided it.<br /><br />The paragraph above describes a lot of what we do here, "frantically trying to cross the street." &nbsp;Today I came home exhausted from walking around on the ice. &nbsp;Walking on the ice is just as slippery as you're imagining, but there's miles of it, it's not just a few mud puddles that froze over. &nbsp;The sidewalks are all covered in a fresh inch-thick layer of ice, ice that used to be snow that was subsequently packed down by ten million feet and then frozen again.<br /><br />This morning I slipped and fell on the ice, again, I think it's the fourth time I've fallen since I've been here. &nbsp;I wasn't hurt, I just fell on my butt. &nbsp;But I got a good laugh out of my two friends behind me. &nbsp;"You fall slowly!" they said. &nbsp;Yes, it happened in slow motion. &nbsp;That's what happened last time. &nbsp;I fall in slow motion. &nbsp;Maybe someday you'll be lucky enough to see it yourself.<br /><br />During this "Great Thaw" as I like to think of it, this little town is starting to come alive and act more like I'd expect a city in Asia to behave. &nbsp;There are street vendors popping up all over the place on the sidewalks. &nbsp;And my favorite part is the little "bucket tables."<br /><br />Street vendors usually have a little portable kitchen about six feet wide and four feet deep. &nbsp;(It occurs to me that I have no idea how then get them there every day, they have wheels I guess) &nbsp;The street vendors usually line up on either side of the sidewalk in rows so you can walk between them and smell their delicious food. &nbsp;I told Dave the other day that it reminded me of a state fair back home. &nbsp;We both wished they had funnel cakes and elephant ears. &nbsp;Oh! and those fried "blooming" onions!<br /><br />Now these street vendors did not entirely disappear during the cold months, but there wasn't nearly as many of them as there are now. &nbsp;And none of them had "bucket tables" like they do now. &nbsp;Some of the street vendors have set up a little square table with four, usually red, buckets around each side. &nbsp;I think it'll be kind of nice, if you're impatient like me, and you want to eat it immediately, while it's hot, there's a little kid-sized table right there for your convenience.<br /><br />But it amazes me because it's still only 25 degrees outside and people are eating on the sidewalk like it's a hot day. &nbsp;Well I guess it is hot outside, relatively speaking.<br /><br />
