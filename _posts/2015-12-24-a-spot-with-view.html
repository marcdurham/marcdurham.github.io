A few days ago I found myself standing in an interesting spot, at least I thought it was interesting.&nbsp; <br /><br />I was led there, to this interesting spot, by a friend to wait for another friend to go somewhere else.&nbsp; So I probably couldn't find my way back to this spot on my own.&nbsp; It was a short bus ride to get there and it was in front of what I'll call a "market street".&nbsp; This market street looks more like what I'd imagine a Chinese street to look like if I'd never been here.&nbsp; What I'm saying is that most streets here don't look like this. It even has one of those big Chinese gates arching over the road like you see in China-town in Seattle, and probably in other "China-towns".&nbsp; I always thought that was just something quaint we did in America to identify where a "China-town" starts, but I was surprised to find these ornate, but door-less, "gates" all over the place in Taiwan, and now one here, in China.&nbsp; But that's where we ended up, standing near a Chinese gate listening to catchy techno music and the traffic.&nbsp; I did a few dance moves, but not enough to attract attention.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4gwML2J5xw/VnpIhcT1DuI/AAAAAAABj94/-6w2Kxhdve4/s1600/China%2BGate.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x4gwML2J5xw/VnpIhcT1DuI/AAAAAAABj94/-6w2Kxhdve4/s320/China%2BGate.jpg" width="240" /></a></div>I noticed something I hadn't seen yet here: tuk-tuks.&nbsp; I know that's not what they call them here, "tuk-tuk" is a Thailand term, three wheeled, two seated, taxis.&nbsp; That was the only place I'd seen them until now.&nbsp; Only here they are completely enclosed, which makes sense because it's really cold here!&nbsp; You can see a couple of them in the picture. <br /><br />I thought this spot was kind of picturesque, in an odd way, looking from behind that gate looking out over the wide busy street towards a couple rows of tall slender, brand-new and probably unoccupied high-rise apartment buildings in the distance.&nbsp; A little pile of garbage piled at next to the gate.&nbsp; My favorite part of this view was on one of the red wooden round pillars on either side of the gate.&nbsp; The pillar on the left has a two character message, basically graffiti, penciled across it: 中国.<br /><br />95% of Chinese characters, graffiti or otherwise, confuse me as they confuse you, unless you happen to be learning Chinese.&nbsp; Yes I've learned some of the verbal, but not much of the visual: I need to learn how to read those things, I know, I know.&nbsp; But in this case I was happy and not frustrated because these two characters were very familiar, I knew what they said, they said: "China".<br /><br />I'm not sure what the message really meant.&nbsp; I'm not sure why someone would write "China" on a red post in the middle of China.&nbsp; Most people wouldn't see unless they were standing right there listening to techno music.&nbsp; I guess that's what you see when you look through that gate: you see "China" beyond that gate, but then again it's also behind you.&nbsp; But that's what I was looking at anyway, and that's what I was thinking about: China.<br /><br />I'm trying to imagine someone writing "United States" on some sort of unremarkable landmark, in pencil, somewhere on some unremarkable intersection in Seattle.&nbsp; On the other hand, I just remarked about it, so now it's remarkable.&nbsp; I might even find myself awake tonight thinking about it, wondering why anyone would write it, and why they would write it in pencil.
