I was listening to&nbsp;<a href="http://kuow.org/programs/takeaway-kuow">The Takeaway on KUOW</a>&nbsp;to an interview about the brain, short term memory, problem solving and creativity. &nbsp;Here's what I took from it:<br /><br /><ul><li>A 15 minute nap can increase your IQ by ten points. &nbsp;</li><li>The short term memory really only holds three of four things at a time.</li><li>Watching TV, or YouTube, might be relaxing but doesn't stimulate the lower "Creative" areas of the brain.</li><li>FAA flight controllers are required to take 15-30 minutes breaks every 45-60 minutes.</li><li>Staring out the window stimulates the lower "Creative" areas of the brain. &nbsp;You can also take a (quiet) walk and not think about work.</li></ul>
