      <!--StartFragment-->   <!--EndFragment--><br /><div style="border-width: 100%; direction: ltr;"> <div style="direction: ltr; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in; width: 6.109in;"> <div style="direction: ltr; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0in; width: 6.109in;"> <div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I can finally spell Seoul now, and I've finally been there. &nbsp;Which is weird because I'd already been to Korea two times before that, all in one year.&nbsp;</div><div style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">When I was there, in Seoul, I had the "I've got soul but I'm not a soldier" song by "The Shins" stuck in my head most of the time. &nbsp;Becky was the only one around to hear it, poor thing, and I sometimes tried to add to the lyric: "I'm in Seoul but I'm not a soldier," but it was never as funny as I'd hoped. &nbsp;Hoping that something will be funny is a good sign that it won't be.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">To me it's weird to say things like "This is my third time in Korea this year."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I'm not a traveling businessman, or rich and retired, or young and trying to find myself, or whatever it is that makes people travel a lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Although I do like seeing new things and places I'd have to say that I have a below average desire to travel the world, I don't have a "travel bug."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But on our trip back from Seoul I was staring at the back of the airplane seat in front of me trying to remember how many times I'd been on an airplane recently, and it was a little fuzzy: China, Jeju Island in Korea, Taiwan, Beijing, Incheon Korea, Seoul Korea. So six times.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">But, in case it sounds like I'm bragging too much about how many places I've been, I have a confession to all travel lovers and adventurists: I didn't really do anything in most of those places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am a terrible, stick-in-the-mud, traveler.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Even I, as I'm typing this, am shaking my head in disgust at myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All the expense, the preparation, hours of buying tickets online with bad internet connections, sitting in cramped airplane seats, trudging through airports, getting stuck in long security lines with only minutes to spare… and I'm just not motivated to do anything cool when I go places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In Seoul we ate at Outback Steakhouse for lunch, it wasn't very good, and then we ate at Costco and had pizza and a hot dog for dinner, it was delicious!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But no Korean barbeque, no Bibimbop, nothing new and Korean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Not even Sushi, which is plentiful in Korea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>OK I admit I really regret that last one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I saw someone throw away a partially uneaten tray of sushi at Costco, and it broke my heart.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">I should defend our decisions though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Going to Korea is like going a little bit closer to home for us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Korea is saturated with English, some things, signs and stuff, have only English with no Korean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Korea also has things like Costco, Krispy Kreme, Taco Bell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In Korea I can use a VISA card to buy things, that's pretty cool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In Korea they have Google and our Android phones actually work, we can use<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>maps to navigate places!</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Of course we don't have Korean, or even American, SIM cards in our cell phones so we were not able to use the aforesaid Google maps without some sort of free Wi-Fi connection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It's actually a little bit puzzling to me that tourist brochures have websites and phone numbers on them when there's a good chance the tourists won't have working phones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Although it might be puzzling to the people who made those brochures that I didn't buy one of those SIM cards that they are selling at the airport.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But it's hard to justify buying one when you're only there for such a short time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Next time I think I will though.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">But anyway, we were far more excited to be out of China than we were to be in Korea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Let's just say: We miss home.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">Even though Seoul Korea has so much English, and is so convenient, we did find ourselves next to a rice patty, with dirt roads leading into it, in the dark, on a pedestrian-less road waiting for a bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our phones were both dead, even though they didn't have Internet connections they did have the address to our hotel in case we needed to give it to a Taxi driver or something. Not that we could really get a Taxi because we only had a few dollars left in our pockets, and I wasn't sure how much money was left on our bus cards.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">And when I said there's lots of English in Korea, that means on the signs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Bus drivers, and anyone else, get really stressed out when you try speaking English to them, they can read it sometimes but they can't speak it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I just have a really mean scary face…</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">We ended up next to the rice patty (did I mention that it started to rain) because we got on the right bus going the wrong direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It took at least twenty minutes for me to realize that we had crossed too many bridges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yes, I'm getting a SIM card next time.</div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">But the story has a happy ending, eventually we ended up back at the airport, which was one of the stops on the bus route, transferring to the next bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We tried swiping our bus cards (or T-Cards as they call them) but the bus driver made an X with his arms indicating that we didn't need to swipe our T-Cards, of course it was too late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Then, after that, we were running through the rain, me in shorts, down a poorly lit street sidewalk that badly needed to be weeded, from the bus stop closest to our little hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We even stopped at 7-Eleven, dripping wet, and got some Kimchee to eat in our hotel room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="color: black; font-family: -webkit-standard; font-size: 11.0pt; margin: 0in;">So it turns out that the Kimchee in Korea, even at 7-Eleven, is really good, so the trip wasn't a total waste after all.</div></div></div></div>
