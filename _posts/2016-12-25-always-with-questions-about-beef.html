Tonight is another night I just can't sleep, it's already 3AM. &nbsp;I don't have any fun stories about eating pig parts. &nbsp;But we have noticed a pattern of questions here...<br /><br />I really noticed it this summer. &nbsp;During the summer it was very hot. &nbsp;I was with a friend visiting a mom and her twelve year old son. &nbsp;In China, as it is in the rest of Asia and even in the U.S., it is customary to remove your shoes when entering someone's home. &nbsp;It is also customary here for them to provide you with slippers.<br /><br />On that particular hot day I don't remember if the slippers were too small for me or not. &nbsp;It's not uncommon for people to not have slippers large enough for my feet, although there are plenty of large people here, maybe their feet are small, I don't know, but it happens. &nbsp;But I do remember that I wore sandals that day so I had bare feet once I slipped my sandals off.<br /><br />As we were about to leave the twelve year old boy pointed at my feet in amazement and everyone looked at the crazy barefoot American standing on the hot cement floor. <br /><br />Was I cold? &nbsp;Weren't my feet cold? &nbsp;Frankly I didn't understand the line of questioning, it was over 95 degrees outside and inside, wouldn't cold feet be desirable? &nbsp;But they weren't cold, I was hot!<br /><br />The twelve year old boy joyously kicked off his house slippers as if kicking off shackles and chains. &nbsp;He said that he was going to be barefoot too!<br /><br />But his mother immediately told him to put his slippers back on and that the only reason that I was able to do it was that my body was different because I ate beef all the time.<br /><br />Yes, beef. &nbsp;I have heard this so many times: Americans eat beef. &nbsp;Of course it is true, the average American eats more beef than the average Chinese person. &nbsp;Everyone asks us if Americans eat lamb, or sheep. &nbsp;Yes, we tell them, but a lot of people don't like it, we don't eat it as often as beef... &nbsp;I must have said it a hundred times!<br /><br />Just what does that kid's mother think will happen to him if he doesn't wear slippers in the house when it's hot outside? &nbsp;Is she worried that he won't put them back on in the winter and it gets cold out? &nbsp;Actually it makes sense to me that the locals here insist that slippers should be worn, the floors are usually cement and usually cold and hard. &nbsp;Cold is a very real thing to be reckoned with here. It's just strange to me that we need a wive's tale about how you must wear slippers at all times so you don't die. &nbsp;Seems like kids would just want to do it on their own when it was cold.<br /><br />Now recently it hasn't been hot outside, it's actually very cold. &nbsp;And I wear a huge down filled jacket, hat, mittens, insulated pants, thermals, everything, it all keeps me warm. &nbsp;But the trouble with all that insulation is that when I get inside and I can't take it off right away, or I have to hike up five flights of stairs: &nbsp;I tend to sweat a lot. <br /><br />So I usually wear a teeshirt and sometimes a flannel shirt under my huge jacket so that I can quickly take off, or open, my jacket and flannel and cool off as fast as possible, which I do often. &nbsp;But so many times I get comments about how "lee-hai" I am wearing my t-shirt. &nbsp;"Lee-hai" I think can translate into "fierce". &nbsp;They seem quite impressed, even though people here ride motorcycles through the -35 degree wind bare faced with shaved heads, no helmets, scarves, or hats. &nbsp;-35 degrees is crazy cold, it makes the exposed parts of my skin burn within seconds when I'm just standing there, with a hat and a scarf.<br /><br />I am always confused by the questions. &nbsp;You think I'd just learn to move past it, just nod my head or something. &nbsp;But every time these questions and comments flabbergast me. &nbsp;Did they not see the huge four-inch thick jacket I just peeled off? &nbsp;Or didn't they notice the sweat dripping down my face and that I also took off a sweat wet flannel? Does the temperature inside, which is usually quite warm, feel different to them? &nbsp;(Actually it probably does)<br /><br />And, yes, of course I've been asked more than once if I can wear T-shirts in December because I eat beef all the time. &nbsp;Recently I was asked that in a restaurant right after lunch, but the person who asked had just ate beef and lamb with us, we all just ate the same thing.<br /><br />I think I need to turn the tables on the people here and turn the questioning back around on them. &nbsp;Maybe I'll ask them if they're wearing long sleeve shirts because they eat rice or noodles every day... &nbsp;Or maybe I'll just get over it and learn to just nod my head: &nbsp;Yep, I eat beef every day, that's why I am the way I am. &nbsp;Slippers? Don't need 'em! I ate beef for breakfast this morning.
