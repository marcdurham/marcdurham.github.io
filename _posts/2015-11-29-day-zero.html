I'm sitting in an airport terminal listening to soft Chinese chatter. &nbsp;This is my first exposure to what is probably, I'm assuming, the accent of the people of the city where I am going to live for the next year or more. &nbsp;Of course I have not strained my ears enough yet to understand any of it...<div>Speaking of understanding: My wife laughed at me about an hour ago when I came back to the table, in an airport restaurant, with a full tray of food. &nbsp;My second tray. &nbsp;I only wanted the fried tofu, but apparently I ordered "the meal", which come with little side dishes. &nbsp;I think it was #8. &nbsp;</div><div>"Here we go again" I said to myself. &nbsp;I almost forgot about the confusion of ordering from a Chinese menu, pointing and nodding.</div><div>But I solved this problem by eating almost the whole tray. &nbsp;No problem. &nbsp;My "Xbox Music" T-Shirt, which I found in a give-away pile at work is sized XL. &nbsp;</div><div>We have overcome a few obstacles on the way here. &nbsp;Overweight carry-ons, a missing sock. &nbsp;Well that's all that I can remember.</div><div>Ok they're boarding! Better go! &nbsp;I can't wait to fill out immigration forms, or tourist forms or whatever they're called</div>
