I've been in America for the last three weeks or so. &nbsp;I wasn't sure what to expect from myself coming back to America, or "The States" as we say sometimes, it had been a long time since I'd driven a car. &nbsp;Becky wondered if I'd feel different in The States because nobody would be staring at me or treating me like a celebrity. &nbsp;Not really, I haven't noticed.
