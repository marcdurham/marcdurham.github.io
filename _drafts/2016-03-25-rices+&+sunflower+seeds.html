<br />Farewell Rices! &nbsp;Dave and Irene will be leaving us soon. &nbsp;They'll be gone, far far away in America, for three months. &nbsp;Becky and I will miss them in more ways than one.<div><br /></div><div>We'll miss their company most of all, but we'll also miss Irene's cooking, and Dave's home-made bread and Pizza crust. &nbsp;We'll also miss having people around who know where things are and what's going on, who's who. &nbsp;We've learned a lot of those things in the lasts four months, but not all of it. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I can't count the amount of times we've gone over to someone's home, or to some special part of the city, and just got into a taxi and showed up magically. &nbsp;Dave had told the driver right where to go. &nbsp;Kind of like being a kid, riding around in the back seat with mom and dad. &nbsp;Now Becky and I are being cast off into adulthood, having to feed ourselves, stock our own fridge, and pay our own bills all by ourselves. &nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But don't worry, we can always call mom and dad, who are younger than we are, on Skype, and ask them: "Where do we buy those purple fruits with white insides? &nbsp;I've asked the locals, but they don't know what I'm talking about." &nbsp;or "The gas for the stove seems to be out, I figured out how to recharge the little credit card that goes into the meter, but how do I put it back in? &nbsp;Do I put it in with the chip facing up or facing down?"</div><div><br /></div><div>We'll also miss them on "Voyager Nights" when we watch an episode or two of "Star Trek: Voyager" in order. &nbsp;Will we watch it without them? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;We won't have much else to entertain us with them gone, so we might keep watching it. &nbsp;But it won't be the same.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, we won't be quite as fast at crossing the street without Irene, who pushed the limits of safety and sanity. &nbsp;Imagine a busy street of six lanes all going one direction... now cross it. &nbsp;That's Irene, walking through the gaps between moving cars, remember the three second rule, that's where she walks. &nbsp;I've tried to record a video of it several times, but it never works for some reason.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>We'll certainly miss the constant flow of roasted sunflower seeds. &nbsp;Irene always made sure that there was a cellophane bag of sunflower seeds sitting on the kitchen table. &nbsp;It was often Dave that actually went outside and got it, but Irene made sure he got the right kind from the right vendor. &nbsp;I actually upturned this nearly perfect arrangement for a few weeks when I found a street vendor slightly farther away that sold even bigger sunflower seeds that tasted even better. &nbsp;But it wasn't long until the quality went down for some reason and we had to go back to the original vendor. &nbsp;I learned my lesson.</div><div><br /></div><div>In case I've forgotten to mention it, I think since we've been here, we've consumed at least a hundred pounds of sunflower seeds between the four of us. &nbsp;They sell them everywhere here, but, like I said, we only get them from one street vendor. &nbsp;We've got connections. &nbsp;And we have an addiction to sunflower seeds.</div><div><br /></div><div>So if you run into the Rices while they're in America, don't try giving them low quality sunflower seeds, it will only disappoint them. &nbsp;Remind them to go back to China soon and tell them "Hi" for me.</div><div><br /></div>
