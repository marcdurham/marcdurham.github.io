Sometimes it's fun being a foreigner, sometimes it's kinda sad. <br /><br />Today I was on a particularly long bus ride, on bus 107. &nbsp;I sat by the window with one seat open next to me. &nbsp;When I got on there weren't many people yet, I actually got a seat. &nbsp;I was wondering who would end up sitting next to me how long of a conversation I'd be able to hold with them. &nbsp;What could I say? &nbsp;"Hello. &nbsp;Are you from around here?" &nbsp;No I didn't know how to say that. &nbsp;How about: "Hello, are you from this city?" &nbsp;Yes I could say that. &nbsp;But it seemed kind of silly, of course they were from here, everyone I talk to is from here. &nbsp;"Hello. &nbsp;Where are you from?" &nbsp;Even worse.<br /><br />As I was worrying about these details. (Maybe I could ask them if they had kids!) I noticed that most people were finding other seats. &nbsp;Of course! &nbsp;I was a weird foreigner, who would sit next to me? &nbsp;I hope that was it. &nbsp;Although I wonder what kind of a face I was making as I was imagining those possible conversations. &nbsp;I wonder if it was the same face I was making when I was sitting across from those other foreigners who smelled good and I resisted telling them about it so I wouldn't sound creepy.<br /><br />Eventually a couple old ladies sat by me, one after the other, but the first one ignored my: "NiHao" and the other one looked a little scared and confused when I tried talking to her. &nbsp;My current theory about this confusion, which I get commonly here is that: A: My Chinese is bad, I have a thick accent. B: &nbsp;The locals here are not used to hearing foreign accents. &nbsp;And when you combine that with the strangeness of my appearance, dare I say scariness? &nbsp;(I may have forgotten to comb my hair) it's just a big confusing jumble of alienness. &nbsp;Imagine sitting on a bus next to a Klingon and he turns to you and says "Hello, are you from around here?" to you with a thick Scottish accent, only you've never heard a Scottish accent before.<br /><br /><br />
