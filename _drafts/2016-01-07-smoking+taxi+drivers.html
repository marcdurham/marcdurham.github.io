<div dir="ltr">Imagine if someone decided to smoke on a crowded bus.&nbsp; <br />You might think I'm complaining about people smoke on buses here, and I am a little bit, but what's interesting to me is that no one seems to care.&nbsp; Of course I've only seen this, or smelled it, happen once so far.<br />Maybe no one complained because the smoker was the bus driver himself. Of course he did have the window open which, as you may know, doesn't suck all the smoke out.</div>
