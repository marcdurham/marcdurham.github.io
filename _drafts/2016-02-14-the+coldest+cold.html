Not more than ten minutes ago I was outside, walking home from the bus stop, in the coldest cold I've ever felt. <br /><br />They often post a "Wind chill" temperature too, which seems kinda silly sometimes, but I haven't seen one. &nbsp;It's not really windy, it's just a light breeze. &nbsp;But my hands are still burning as they thaw out. &nbsp;Apparently, according to a weather website, the temperature is only -5 degrees F, merely. &nbsp;We've had -25 degrees many times since I've been here, but I've never felt so cold in my life. &nbsp;My skin burned, I took my hands out to answer my phone. &nbsp;It was less than a minute conversation, but my hands still hurt from it.
