Well I'm in Korea now. &nbsp;To be precise: I'm on Jeju Island, South Korea, Best Western Hotel. &nbsp;We will be here for six days total. &nbsp;Our primary purpose coming here is to get our passports stamped which resets our Chinese Visas which, although they last ten years, only allow 60 day visits. &nbsp;So we're technically tourists touring Asia, technically and practically. &nbsp;I'm not sure where we'll go next.<br /><br />Before you get excited, thinking that we're seeing amazing sites and drinking drinks with little umbrellas, I'd like to point out that we plan to spend a majority our time on Jeju Island in our 13th floor hotel room. <br /><br />Jeju Island is covered with palm trees, but there is also snow on the ground, it's winter, so no beach visits. &nbsp;It's an island famous for it's casinos, but we don't gamble. &nbsp;It is also famous for a volcano and a waterfall that falls into the ocean. &nbsp;We might try to see to the waterfall but seeing the volcano requires hiking, and due to old-people problems, including slipping on an icy street in Harbin and landing on my knee, we are unable to walk very far. &nbsp;We're also trying to save money.
